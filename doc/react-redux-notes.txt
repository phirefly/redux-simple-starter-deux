## Components vs containers
We want to decide on a component or Container
When to use a container -> when we want to a component to touch the Redux state directly

# How to make a component a container
1. Create a new file in the 'containers' folder
2. Add the necessary boilerplate to make it available in the template
3. Import into the template
4. Hook it up to the redux store
- Import the Connect helpder
- Connect our application state to the props of the container (by defining a function 'mapStateToProps')
- Connect 'mapStateToProps' to the container
